<h2>THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was an old Sow with three little Pigs,
and as she had not enough to keep them, she sent them out to seek their
fortune.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">

<p>The first that went off met a Man with a bundle of straw, and said to
him, "Please, Man, give me that straw to build me a house"; which the
Man did, and the little Pig built a house with it. Presently came along
a Wolf, and knocked at the door, and said, "Little Pig, little Pig, let
me come in."</p>

<p>To which the Pig answered, "No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin."</p>
<p><br></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="./Story of the Three Little Pigs_files/imgplate-2.jpg" alt="Then I&#39;ll huff and I&#39;ll puff" title="Then I&#39;ll huff and I&#39;ll puff"></div>
<p><br></p>
<p>"Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house
in!" said the Wolf. So he huffed and he puffed, and he blew his house
in, and ate up the little Pig.</p>

<p>The second Pig met a Man with a bundle of furze, and said, "Please, Man,
give me that furze to build a house"; which the Man did, and the Pig
built his house.</p>
<p><br></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="./Story of the Three Little Pigs_files/img004.jpg" alt="Then along came the Wolf" title="Then along came the Wolf"></div>


<p>Then along came the Wolf and said, "Little Pig, little Pig, let me come
in."</p>

<p>"No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin."</p>

<p>"Then I'll puff and I'll huff, and I'll blow your house in!" So he
huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed, and at last he blew
the house down, and ate up the second little Pig.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="./Story of the Three Little Pigs_files/img005.jpg" alt="The wolf" title="The wolf"></div>


<p>The third little Pig met a Man with a load of bricks, and said, "Please,
Man, give me those bricks to build a house with"; so the Man gave him
the bricks, and he built his house with them. So the Wolf came, as he
did to the other little Pigs, and said, "Little Pig, little Pig, let me
come in."</p>

<p>"No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin."</p>

<p>"Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."</p>
<p><br></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="./Story of the Three Little Pigs_files/imgplate-3.jpg" alt="He built his house with bricks" title="He built his house with bricks"></div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Well, he huffed and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, and he
puffed and he huffed; but he could <i>not</i> get the house down. When he
found that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the
house down, he said, "Little Pig, I know where there is a nice field of
turnips."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="./Story of the Three Little Pigs_files/img006.jpg" alt="He could not get the house down" title="He could not get the house down"></div>

<p>"Where?" said the little Pig.</p>



<p>"Oh, in Mr. Smith's home-field; and if you will be ready to-morrow
morning, I will call for you, and we will go together and get some for
dinner."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the little Pig, "I will be ready. What time do you
mean to go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, at six o'clock."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="./Story of the Three Little Pigs_files/img007.jpg" alt="I will be ready" title="I will be ready"></div>


<p>Well, the little Pig got up at five, and got the turnips and was home
again before six. When the Wolf came he said, "Little Pig, are you
ready?"</p>

<p>"Ready!" said the little Pig, "I have been and come back again, and got
a nice pot-full for dinner."</p>
<p><br></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="./Story of the Three Little Pigs_files/imgplate-4.jpg" alt="A nice pot-full for dinner" title="A nice pot-full for dinner"></div>
<p><br></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="./Story of the Three Little Pigs_files/imgplate-5.jpg" alt="Pig and turnips" title="Pig and turnips"></div>

<p><br></p>
<p>The Wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that he would be <i>up to</i>
the little Pig somehow or other; so he said, "Little Pig, I know where
there is a nice apple-tree."</p>

<p>"Where?" said the Pig.</p>

<p>"Down at Merry-garden," replied the Wolf; "and if you will not deceive
me I will come for you, at five o'clock to-morrow, and we will go
together and get some apples."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="./Story of the Three Little Pigs_files/img008.jpg" alt="The little Pig woke at four" title="The little Pig woke at four"></div>


<p>Well, the little Pig woke at four the next morning, and bustled up, and
went off for the apples, hoping to get back before the Wolf came; but
he had farther to go, and had to climb the tree, so that just as he was
coming down from it, he saw the Wolf coming, which, as you may suppose,
frightened him very much. When the Wolf came up he said, "Little Pig,
what! are you here before me? Are they nice apples?"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="./Story of the Three Little Pigs_files/img009.jpg" alt="He had to climb the tree" title="He had to climb the tree"></div>


<p>"Yes, very," said the little Pig; "I will throw you down one." And he
threw it so far that, while the Wolf was gone to pick it up, the
little Pig jumped down and ran home.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="./Story of the Three Little Pigs_files/imgplate-6.jpg" alt="The little pig jumped down" title="The little pig jumped down"></div>
<p><br></p>

<p>The next day the Wolf came again, and said to the little Pig, "Little
Pig, there is a Fair in the Town this afternoon: will you go?"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="./Story of the Three Little Pigs_files/img010.jpg" alt="The wolf came again" title="The wolf came again"></div>

<p>"Oh, yes," said the Pig, "I will go; what time shall you be ready?"</p>

<p>"At three," said the Wolf.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="./Story of the Three Little Pigs_files/img011.jpg" alt="The little pig at the fair" title="The little pig at the fair"></div>

<p>So the little Pig went off before the time, as usual, and got to the
Fair, and bought a butter churn, and was on his way home with it when he
saw the Wolf coming. Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into
the churn to hide, and in doing so turned it round, and it began to
roll, and rolled down the hill with the Pig inside it, which frightened
the Wolf so much that he ran home without going to the Fair.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="./Story of the Three Little Pigs_files/imgplate-7.jpg" alt="So he got into
the churn to hide" title="So he got into
the churn to hide"></div>
<p><br></p>

<p>He went to the little Pig's house, and told him how frightened he had
been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="./Story of the Three Little Pigs_files/img012.jpg" alt="Rolling down the hill" title="Rolling down the hill"></div>


<p>Then the little Pig said, "Hah! I frightened you, did I? I had been to
the Fair and bought a butter churn, and when I saw you I got into it,
and rolled down the hill."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="./Story of the Three Little Pigs_files/img013.jpg" alt="Wolf on the roof" title="Wolf on the roof"></div>


<p>Then the Wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he <i>would</i> eat up the
little Pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="./Story of the Three Little Pigs_files/imgplate-8.jpg" alt="He hung on the pot full of
water" title="He hung on the pot full of
water"></div>
<p><br></p>

<p>When the little Pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of
water, and made up a blazing fire, and, just as the Wolf was coming
down, took off the cover of the pot, and in fell the Wolf. And the
little Pig put on the cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and ate
him for supper, and lived happy ever after.</p>

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
